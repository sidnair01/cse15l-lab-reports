Streamlining ssh Configuration

I'm going to explain the process of how I streamlined my ssh Configuration using the directions from 
Week 5 [Streamlining ssh Configuration](https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/week/week5/#group-choice-1-streamline-ssh-configuration).

Originally, I would remote ssh into ieng6 using key-based authentication. I followed the template ```ssh username@server```, typing out my specific 
cse15l account username.

My first step was moving into my ```.ssh``` folder under the path ```C:\Users\sidna\.ssh```.
I checked if there was a previous config file, which there wasn't.
