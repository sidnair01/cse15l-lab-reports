The objective of our first lab was to remote access and modify files on UCSD campus-machines remotely.

*Installing VSCode*

Download the correct VSCode installer for your operating system. This should open an empty page where new files can be created and written in any language.

*Remotely Connecting*

The first step to remotely connecting is instaling an SSH program, for example, OpenSSH for Windows.
Then create a new terminal in VSCode and type ```ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu```, replacing ```zz``` with the code associated with your own student code. You can find your student code by visiting this [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and entering your username and student ID number. You may or may not be required to change your account password.

*Trying some Commands*

*Moving Files with* ```scp```

*Setting an SSH Key*

*Optimizing Remote Running*
